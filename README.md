## Sparta Rails Blog Homework

##### Description: I made a simple application using ruby on rails that allows the user to create a user account and view technologies on the app and add to them, whilst being limited to only being able to edit their own submitted tech. They can also leave comments on other users' submissions - along with being able to view their profiles.
**Creator: Ryan Lecoutre**

**Technology Used - Atom, Ruby on Rails, Google Chrome **

## Challenges:

1. Trying to fix the error that we uncovered on Friday afternoon relating to the missing 'first_name' of tech!

## Takeaways:

1. Improved my bug hunting ability and resilience - the vast majority of the time I spent on this over the weekend was dedicated solely to fixing the bug - I did not want to accept defeat and simply start the project over again!

## Instructions on How to Download:
1. Enter the GitHub repo.
2. Copy the SSH to clipboard.
3. In your command line, enter the folder you wish to insert the files.
4. Type ‘git clone’ followed by pasting the SSH into the command line.
5. Type 'gem install rails' in your command line
6. Open the code in your chosen text editor, such as Atom.
7. Type in 'rake db:create db:seed db:migrate' in your command line to create the database.
8. Type in 'rails s' in your command line to start the server.
9. Open it on 'localhost:3000' in your browser.
